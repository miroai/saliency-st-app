# Saliency Based Image Cropping

This repo was forked by the [Miro team](https://miro.io/#) to create the interface [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jho/vox_saliency_demo).

The [original Vox Video](https://www.vox.com/videos/2021/3/31/22348722/ai-bias-racial-machine-learning) highlights the issues with Twitter's image cropping algorithm. The work here is based upon [Vinay Prabhu's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinay-prabhu-84619785/) previous work for the Vox Video. His [medium article](https://vinayprabhu.medium.com/scrutinizing-saliency-based-image-cropping-6b7a70cfb4f1) explains further in details.

The model used is the [TensorFlow Implementation of MSI-Net](https://github.com/alexanderkroner/saliency) which archived [SoTA performance](https://saliency.tuebingen.ai/results.html) on the [MIT Saliency Benchmark dataset](http://saliency.mit.edu/datasets.html)
